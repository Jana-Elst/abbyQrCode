## 🕮 Our 'Moedige poging' bible a.k.a agreements 
1. Everyone shall work at their own pace and time, but the agreed upon tasks should be done by a determined deadline
2. We shall keep each other up to date during a 15 min call each day
⁠3. Everyone shall be open about what they are working and notify if they need help
4. Everyone shall trust one another and don’t put all the workload on themselves or push it to someone else
5. We shall meet each monday and each coordinator has prepared what they want to do that week and what/who they need that week and we make a todo list and planning together
